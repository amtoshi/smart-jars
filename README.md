Smart Jars are deposit balances for Wise personal accounts which helps users save as they spend using Micro-deposits (like micro investing)  depositing a spare amount with every transaction to complete their budgeting goals for travel, buying something. They are a feature extension on Jars.

Jars have been part of the Wise account for a while now, But currently they are just deposit balances with a name, currency and emoji. But wait till it becomes smart. The solution tries to re-introduce Jars as Smart jars which are enabled with Micro deposit feature.  It is targeted towards Wise user who spends using cards or makes transfers for everyday expense.


*Lets take Joe.  Joe plans to travel to Turkey for new years. He would like to budget and save for the trip . 
He tries the smart Jar, The smart Jar asks joe what is he saving for, he mentions travel and then the onboarding page of Jar feature asks him what country, how many days, date of travel and is it a budget, medium or lavish trip . Based on these data points it calculates what is the cost of the for him to save. 
smart jar then asks him whether he wants to __Save some when he Spends- this is micro deposit. Which calculates and saves a sum every time he spends.__ Like let’s say according to his goal, it should be 5 euros everyday? then the apps will try to have a sum extracted from his everyday purchases, transaction using Wise and at the end of the day will notify him of reaching his daily goal.* 

I havent done a full fledged competitive study but it will a novel way for users to save for their travel plans and when they do it, it can potentially make them to use wise card to spend on their trip.   Same saving model can be applied to not only travel but just saving up to buy something like television, phone.

__This is inline with convenience features of the product roadmap in now &next like   Hold money in different assets in
your Wise account, Get your salary or pension paid to your Wise account and is also based on Spending and Budgeting__
It sets us apart from normal remittance based companies and if investing become a part of our product, it will help a smoother transition.

#### competitive landscape:
Revolut does it with their vaults feature but it has no time based tracking, our gamification of smart jar can have a better follow through as we inceptive and help keep users track of their everyday goal.


#### Validation 
- i interviewed 3 of my traveller friends . They travelled in different frequencies and they said its a great idea as saving up can be challenge and they use wise when they travel so they dont have to leave the platform. __One product suggestion__ was that the travel cost estimator*(free API service i plan to use)* service might not be accurate for everyone so have an option to set amount as a user as well.
I would love to part of the mission of Smart Jars and if i were to head it or get to develop it i would have  KPIs apart from testing the onboarding flow to understand success/failure 
 
#### KPIs to keep in mind
- number of Smart Jars created, 
- stickiness of micro deposit: How many users follow through the saving goals
- increase in users because of smart jars
- Smart Jars users who end up getting card for travelling.
